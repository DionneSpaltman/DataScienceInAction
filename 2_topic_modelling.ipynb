    "# Topic Modeling Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have abstracts from papers (e.g., 100 papers), you can use **topic modeling** to automatically extract the main themes (topics) from the text. These topics can then be used to **match user interests** with relevant papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Basic (Vintage) Approach**\n",
    "- Use a **Bag of Words** model to represent text as vectors.\n",
    "- Apply **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)** to identify topics. *(Note: This is not PCA!)*\n",
    "- Simple and quick to implement — can be done in just a few lines of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Advanced Approach**\n",
    "- Use **pretrained transformer models** from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=sentence-similarity&sort=trending).\n",
    "- These models, like **BERT**, are based on the **transformer architecture** and can capture the semantic meaning of text.\n",
    "- Ideal for:\n",
    "  - **Sentence similarity**\n",
    "  - **Text classification**\n",
    "  - **Topic modeling** using embeddings"

      "In many supply chains, firms staged in upstream of the chain suffer from variance amplification emanating from demand information distortion in a multi-stage supply chain and, consequently, their operation inefficiency. Prior research suggest that employing advanced demand forecasting, such as machine learning, could mitigate the effect and improve the performance; however, it is less known what is the extent and magnitude of savings as tangible supply chain performance outcomes. In this research, hybrid demand forecasting methods grounded on machine learning i.e. ARIMAX and Neural Network is developed. Both time series and explanatory factors are feed into the developed method. The method was applied and evaluated in the context of functional product and a steel manufacturer. The statistically significant supply chain performance improvement differences were found across traditional and ML-based demand forecasting methods. The implications for the theory and practice are also presented.\n",

This systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of the research to date related to influences of the Industry 4.0 Revolution on human capital development and consumer behavior. A search on the Web of Science identified 160 papers that met the inclusion criteria. The major objectives aimed to identify: the main types of influences of the Industry 4.0 Revolution on human capital development and consumer behavior; the main opportunities and challenges for new directions in education associated with shifting the work environment; and the drivers for human capital development and consumer behavior through the lenses of the Industry 4.0 Revolution. The results revealed some key aspects for the development of human capital: information, new jobs, the Internet, technology, training, education, new skills, automation, communication, innovativeness, professionals, productivity, artificial intelligence, digitalization, e-recruitment, and the Internet of Things, as well as the main drivers of consumer behavior: information, e-commerce, digitalization, the Internet of Things, e-distribution, technology, digitalization, automation, personalized, performance, artificial intelligence, behavior intention, e-shopping, and data mining.\n",

      "Demand forecasting is one of the main issues of supply chains. It aimed to optimize stocks, reduce costs, and increase sales, profit, and customer loyalty. For this purpose, historical data can be analyzed to improve demand forecasting by using various methods like machine learning techniques, time series analysis, and deep learning models. In this work, an intelligent demand forecasting system is developed. This improved model is based on the analysis and interpretation of the historical data by using different forecasting methods which include time series analysis techniques, support vector regression algorithm, and deep learning models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to blend the deep learning methodology, support vector regression algorithm, and different time series analysis models by a novel decision integration strategy for demand forecasting approach. The other novelty of this work is the adaptation of boosting ensemble strategy to demand forecasting system by implementing a novel decision integration model. The developed system is applied and tested on real life data obtained from SOK Market in Turkey which operates as a fast‐growing company with 6700 stores, 1500 products, and 23 distribution centers. A wide range of comparative and extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed demand forecasting system exhibits noteworthy results compared to the state‐of‐art studies. Unlike the state‐of‐art studies, inclusion of support vector regression, deep learning model, and a novel integration strategy to the proposed forecasting system ensures significant accuracy improvement.\n"
